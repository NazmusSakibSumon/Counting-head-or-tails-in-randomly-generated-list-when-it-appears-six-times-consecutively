Steps to complete this project:
a) At first we will import our libraries and modules.
b) Then we will use those modules and libraries to count heads or tails and the number of occurance of each of head and tail consecutively.
c) Then we will keep only those where the number of consecutive occurance is 6, whether it is head or tail.
d) Next we will identify how many times it is head and how many times it is tail.
e) The results will be different each time we run the whole code. Because the numbers are generated using random library.
